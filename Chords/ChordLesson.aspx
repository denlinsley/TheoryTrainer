    To learn the basics of contructing chords work through two lessons on <a href="http://musictheory.net"  >musictheory.net</a>. 
    Start with the <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/40">Introduction to Chords</a> lesson where you will learn about triads. 
    After you feel comfortable with triads work through the <a href="http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/45">Seventh Chords</a> lesson. 
    Then, you can test your knowledge on my <a href="ChordTrainer.aspx">Chord Trainer</a> page.

    There are 2 basic approaches to learning chords:
    <ol>
      <li>Rote memorization</li>
      <li>Understanding the generic forms of each chord, and then constructing a chord given it's root</li>
    </ol>
    The first approach works well if you just want to get started with chords quickly and learn your favorite
    3-chord song. However, the second approach will serve you better in the long run because you will be able
    to form any chord you might possibly need. This approach is particularly useful if you want to learn songs by
    reading sheet music with chord symbols or tablature.
